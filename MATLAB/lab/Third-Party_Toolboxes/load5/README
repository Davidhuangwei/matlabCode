load5 Matlab .MAT file version 5 load function

load5 is an open-source "load" function for Matlab .MAT version 5 files.  In
addition to most standard features of the load function, load5 adds some
additional features including Partial I/O and reading substructures without
reading the entire structure.

    You can contact me (Christopher Hulbert) through email at cch@isl-inc.com

Contributing:
    If you make changes, I would appreciate your contributions and more than
likely will include them in future releases.  If you are interested in
collaborations, contact me via email at cch@isl-inc.com.  See the file COPYING
for information on reproducing and distributing the code or binaries.

Binaries:
    Precompiled sources are located in the binaries folder.  Distributed
binaries include versions for 32 and 64 bit linux, and 32 bit windows.  32 bit
versions are built against Matlab 6.5 (R13), 64 bit linux is built against
Matlab 7.1 (R14 SP3).

Building:
    Four of the five builds currently supported make use of the GNU autotools,
and thus you should have them.  There is a build script in the top-level
directory for the four builds including the following supported platforms:
cygwin, mingw, linux, and solaris.  You can of course configure and build
your own way.  Recently, a Visual C 7 Solution has been created in the
build-vc7 direcotry.  You should change the paths for include files and
libraries where appropriate.  Before building load5, you will need to obtain
and build libmatio (the Matlab .MAT file I/O library).  You can download this
on the Matlab fle exchange:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadAuthor.do?objectType=author&objectId=1094569.

Targets:
    The library has been tested/used on linux and windows little-endian
architectures, as well as solarix big-endian.
