% Ken's matlab library, everyone is welcome to use it
% Version 0.5.0 1999 May
%
% Clustogram - Draws a shaded clustogram from the Feature file and cluster file.
% ColorScatter -draws a 2d scatter plot of the data with colors allocated according to the vector Colors
% FileExists - tests if a file exists
% FileLines - returns number of lines in a file - USE WordCount instead.
% LoadStringArray - Loads a 2d array of strings from a text file
% LoadStringList - Loads a 1d array of strings from a text file
% MultiReg - does lots of linear regressions at the same time, so you can regress an entire waveform onto a single variable
% OutlierRemoveAuto - An automatic, iterative function to remove outliers from multivariate data
% OutlierRemoveManual - An interactive, iterative function to remove outliers from multivariate data
% PlotConic -Plots the conic section that is the solution of x'*M*x + v'*x + c = 0
% PlotLine - Plots a line w'*x + b = 0
% RealignToPeaks - Realigns waveforms on their peaks
% SpecAv - computes mean power spectrum of a set of traces
% SpikePower - computes the spectra of a set of traces
% SpikePowerMTM - computes the spectra of a set of traces using the multitaper method
% ThresholdCrossings - finds times when a waveform crosses up through a given threshold
% WithinRanges - checks which elements of a vector lie in a specified set of ranges
% WordCount - counts number of words in a file
% bload - loads a binary file
% bsave - saves a binary file
% chi2plot - displays a Chi^2 plot (to check if data come from a Chi^2 distribution)
% clip - limits data above and below
% gnumeric - launch a gnumeric session
% hist2 - plots a 2d histogram
% pplot - plots graphs one at a time with a pause between
% sq - alias for squeeze
% xgobi - launches an xgobi session
