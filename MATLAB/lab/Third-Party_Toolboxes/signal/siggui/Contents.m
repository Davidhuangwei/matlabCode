%              signals, filters, and spectra.  It is the starting point for 
%              using the interactive signal processing environment:
%
%              * Signal Browser  - signal exploration environment
%              * Filter Designer - FIR and IIR digital filter design
%                                  Includes a graphical Pole/Zero Editor
%              * Filter Viewer   - filter characteristics analysis
%              * Spectrum Viewer - power spectral density estimation
