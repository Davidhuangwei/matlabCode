FILETYPE  Get and change file type and creator of a Macintosh file.4/15/97  [OLDTYPE,OLDCREATOR] = FILETYPE(FILENAME,TYPE,CREATOR) gets the Macintosh        file type and creator of the FILENAME, and changes them to TYPE and        CREATOR (if supplied and not empty).  FILENAME may be a string or a        string matrix (in which case each row is DEBLANK'ed and used as a        filename).  The number of rows in TYPE and CREATOR, if supplied and not empty, must  be one or the same as the number of rows in FILENAME.The archive below is a binhexed, self-extracting archive containing them-files and source for FILETYPE.  Included is the MEX file that workson 680x0 and PowerPC Macintoshes in both MATLAB 4 and 5 (along with sourcecode), as well as an Applescript form that works only under MATLAB 5, andonly if the MEX version is removed.  The Applescript form is significantlyslower than the MEX file, but can be edited without having a C compiler.If you have any problems with this code, please drop me mail.Erik A.
