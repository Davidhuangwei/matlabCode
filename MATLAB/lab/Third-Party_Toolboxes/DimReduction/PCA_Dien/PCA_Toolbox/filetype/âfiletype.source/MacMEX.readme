This folder has the source for a Macintosh MEX file, including  1.  <basename>.c      -  C source file  2.  <basename>.¹      -  THINK C 5.0.x project file for the 680x0 code  3.  <basename>.µ      -  CodeWarrior 10 PPC C project file of the PowerPC code  4.  MacMEX.readme     -  this fileInstructions for compiling are:  A.  Make the THINK C project first.  It will create a file named      <basename>.mex.68K that has the 680x0 MEX resource.  B.  Make the CodeWarrior project.  It should create the file <basename>.mex      with the PowerPC code and will place the 680x0 MEX resource from      <basename>.mex.68K in the resource fork of <basename>.mex, thus      creating a MEX file that should run on any Macintosh with Matlab 4.2c      or later (including MATLAB 5).I've tested it on a PowerMac 6100/60AV, an 8100/80AV, and a Mac IIci.Erik A.
