UPDATE NOTES 15/1/98 R.S. Several important updates have been implemented in response to user feedback.  1.  CSDM file format updateThe original CSDM files were setup to only accept integer Epoch lengths.  This has been changed.  Now Epoch lengths can be fractional, which was implemented because of interest in doing short window FFT's on evoked potential data.  However, as a consequence, the header of the CSDM file had to be changed to store real valued Epoch lengths.  The same  was true for all analysiis outputs like power, phase etc.  A utility has been provided to convert old csdm files to new csdm files.  convert_csdmIt can be run with no parameters or it can be passed the filenameconvert_csdm('my_old_csdm_file.aver.csdm')it creates the output file 'my_old_csdm_file.aver.csdm.new'You have to remove the .new after removing the old file.  You have to recreate the power, phase, and coherence files. 2.  New routines to make CSDM files.  Two new routines have been provided to make csdm files:run_eeg_han_csdm run_eeg_han_overlap_csdmThe parameter lists and calls are the same as run_eeg_csdm (see Manual).  The first routine applies a hanning window to the data before the FFT.  The second implements hanning windows and uses 50% overlapping data segments to do the analysis. NOTE:   run_eeg_han_overlap_csdm should only be used on a continuous data fragment. Discontinuous lists of Epochs can lead to piecing together of discontinuous data in the FFT.  3.  Artifact editing I have recieved bug reports that turned out to be problems related to the use of the artifact editing routine run_ns_edit.  If the data is collected with the filter set above 60 Hz there is a lot of 60 Hz noise in the data that is bigger in amplitude than the EEG signal, so the channel can get declared bad even if its not.  IIf you collected your data in this manner, use the filter options in run_ns_edit to lowpass filter at 50 Hz.
