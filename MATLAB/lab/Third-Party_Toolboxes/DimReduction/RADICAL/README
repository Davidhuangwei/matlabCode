This is RADICAL release 1.1. 

Changes from last version:

1) A major bug was found and fixed from
   version 1.0. The whitening matrix was computed incorrectly in previous
   versions. The program worked correctly for pre-whitened data but not
   for non-white data. 

2) The speed has been increased about 20% by changes to the vasicekm.m
   routine.
