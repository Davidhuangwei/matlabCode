The ICA/EEG toolbox has now been downloaded over 1500 times by users from 
many countries and research fields.
Please email feedback about things that do or don't work, 
or any suggested improvements. If you improve your working 
versions of the scripts, please send me a copy or description.
I will credit your suggestions.
<p>
<strong>Some new functions/features in version 3.4:</strong>
<p>
<pre>
** The sign-finding rule for extended-ICA in runica() has been changed to
   the new version published by Lee, Lewicki and Sejnowski. 
** runica() option 'extended' has been made more memory efficient (M. Spratling)
** A 'specgram' preprocessing option has been added to runica() implementing
   frequency domain spatial decomposition, as suggested by M. Zibulevsky.
** Function matcorr() now takes a 3rd argument allowing computing
   correlations without first removing means -- useful for comparing
   scalp maps, and offers new options for pairing components, including 
   VAN and Hungarian (thanks to Sigurd Enghoff).
** Function erpimage() now plots amplitude deviation from baseline (in dB).
   and can now optionally sort data by phase.
** Function blockave() now accepts epoch weights.
** Functions plottopo(), projtopo() and logspec() can now plot rectangular
   [rows cols] arrays of axes.
** A new topoimage() function will plot images in a topographic or rectangular
   arrangement (useful for plotting timef() output over the scalp).
** Function timef() now computes bootstrap limits using surrogate averages 
   drawn from the entire epoch unless BASE_BOOT is set to 1 in the script.
** Function cart2topo() now converts Cartesian xyz channel locations to
   2-D polar coordinates for use in topoplot() and derivative plotting functions
** Function pol2sph() now converts 2-D topoplot() style polar channel locations
   to 3-D spherical coordinates for headplot() and derivatives
** Function sph2pol() now converts 3-D headplot() style spherical channel locations
   to 2-D polar coordinates for topoplot() and derivatives
</pre>
<p>
Changes/bug fixes:
<p>
<pre>
** Function timef() now plots the ERP average below the ITC image
** envtopo() now draws a correct line from the topoplot to clipped data
** erpimage() bugs have been fixed
** timef() frequencies are now correct (shifted by 1 bin)
** crossf() now uses a whole-epoch baseline
</pre>
<p>
Known Bugs:
<br>
<pre>
** In erpimage(), the time-axis tick labels may be missing, and ghost y-scale
   numbers may appear in printed (but not displayed) figures.
** In erpimage(), the 'phase' option may not work in MATLAB 5.2 (ok in 5.3).
