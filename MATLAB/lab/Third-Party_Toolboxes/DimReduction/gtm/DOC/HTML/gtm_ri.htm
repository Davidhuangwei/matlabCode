<title>The GTM Toolbox: gtm_ri</title>

<body><h1>gtm_ri</h1>
Returns an initial random weight matrix.

<p>
Generates a weight matrix with the bias weights set to 
map to the mean of the target distribution and remaining 
weights drawn at random from a Gaussian distribution with 
zero mean and variances choosen so that the variances of 
the generated distribution roughly match the variances 
of the target distribution.

<p>
In addition, an initial value for beta may be calculated as
the inverse of the average distance between each Gaussian 
centre, calculated with the random mapping, and its nearest 
neighbours in the set of data points.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>[W, beta] = gtm_ri(T, FI)</pre><pre>W = gtm_ri(T, FI)</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<code>T</code> - 
sample of target distribution, used for
calculating the mean; one data point
per row; N-by-D

<p>
<code>FI</code> - 
basis functions' activations when fed 
the latent data, X, plus a bias, K-by-(M+1)

<h3>Return</h3>
<code>W</code> - 
the initialised weight matrix; 
(M+1)-by-D

<p>
<code>beta</code> - 
the initial beta value, scalar. This is an 
optional output argument; if omitted, the
corresponding calculations are omitted too.
