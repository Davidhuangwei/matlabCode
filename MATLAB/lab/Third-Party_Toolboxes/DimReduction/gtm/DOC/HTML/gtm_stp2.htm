<title>The GTM Toolbox: gtm_stp2</title>

<body><h1>gtm_stp2</h1>
Generates the components of a GTM with a 2D latent space.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>[X, MU, FI, W, beta] = gtm_stp2(T, noLatVarSmpl, noBasFn, s)</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<code>T</code> - 
target data, to be modelled by the GTM.

<p>
<code>noLatVarSmpl</code> - 
number of samples in the latent variable
space; must be an integer^2, e.g.
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, ...

<p>
<code>noBasFn</code> - 
number of basis functions in the;
must be an integer^2

<p>
<code>s</code> - 
the width of basis functions relative
to the distance between two neighbouring 
basis function centres, i.e. if s = 1,
the basis functions will have widths
(std.dev) equal to (1 times) the distance 
between two neighbouring basis function 
centres.  

<h3>Return</h3>
<code>X</code> - 
the grid of data points making up the
latent variable sample; a matrix of size
noLatVarSmpl-by-2, in which each row is 
a data point

<p>
<code>MU</code> - 
a noBasFn-by-2 matrix holding the 
coordinates of the centres of the  
basis functions

<p>
<code>FI</code> - 
the activations of the basis functions 
when fed the latent variable sample X, 
and a bias unit fixed to 1.0; a matrix 
with the same number of rows as X and 
noBasFn+1 columns (+1 for the bias).

<p>
<code>W</code> - 
the initial matrix of weights, mapping
the latent variable sample X linearly
onto the 2 first principal components 
of the target data (T)

<h3>Notes</h3>
The latent variable sample is constructed as a uniform
grid in the square [-1 -1; -1 1; 1 1; 1 -1]. Similarly
the centres of the basis function are gridded uniformly
over the latent variable sample, with equal standard
deviation, set relative to the distance between neigh-
bouring centres.The initial linear mapping maps the 
std.devs. 1:1 from the latent to the target sample
