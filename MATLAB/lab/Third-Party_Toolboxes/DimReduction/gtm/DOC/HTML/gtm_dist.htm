<title>The GTM Toolbox: gtm_dist</title>

<body><h1>gtm_dist</h1>
Calculate the squared distances between two sets of data points. 

<p>
This function calculates distances between all data 
points in the two data sets T and Y and returns
them in a matrix.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>[DIST, minDist, maxDist] = gtm_dist(T, Y, m)</pre><pre>[DIST] = gtm_dist(T, Y)</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<code>T, Y</code> - 
data set matrices in which each row is a
data point; dimensions N-by-D and K-by-D
respectively

<p>
<code>m</code> - 
mode of calculation; iff m > 0, min- and  
maxDist (below) are calculated; the 
default mode is 0 

<h3>Return</h3>
<code>DIST</code> - 
matrix containing the calculated distances;
dimension K-by-N; DIST(k,n) contains the
squared distance between T(n,:) and Y(k,:).

<p>
<code>minDistmaxDist</code> - 
vectors containing the minimum and 
maximum of each column in DIST, 
respectively; 1-by-N; required 
iff m > 0.

<h3>Notes</h3>
This m-file provides this help comment and a MATLAB
implementation of the distance calculation. If, 
however, a mex-file with the same name is present
in the MATLABPATH, this will be called for doing
the calculation. As this is a computationally 
demanding step of the algorithm, an efficient
mex-file implementation will improve the performance 
of the GTM training algorithm.
