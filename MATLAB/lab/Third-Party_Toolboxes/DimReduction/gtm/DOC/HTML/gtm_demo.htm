<body><h1>gtm_demo</h1>
Demonstrates the GTM with a 2D target space and a 1D latent space.

<p>
This script generates a simple data set in 2 dimensions, 
with an intrinsic dimensionality of 1, and trains a GTM 
with a 1-dimensional latent variable to model this data 
set, visually illustrating the training process

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>gtm_demo</pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The script generates a number of variables which may
overwrite variables already existing in the workspace.
The generated variables remain in the work space after
the script has finished executing.
