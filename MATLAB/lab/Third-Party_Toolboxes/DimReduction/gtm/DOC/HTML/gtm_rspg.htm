<body><h1>gtm_rspg</h1>
Log-likelihood and component responsibilities over a Gaussian mixture

<p>
The responsibilities are returned via the global variable
matrix gtmGlobalR. The responsibility gtmGlobalR(k,n) is 
the probability of a particular component in the Gaussian 
mixture, k, having generated a particular data point, n.
It is calculated from the distances between the data point
n and the centres of the mixture components, 1..K, and the
inverse variance, beta, common to all components. 

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>llh = gtm_rspg(beta, D, mode)</pre><pre>llh = gtm_rspg(beta, D)</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<code>beta</code> - 
a scalar value of the inverse variance common
to all components of the mixture.

<p>
<code>D</code> - 
dimensionality of space where the data and
the Gaussian mixture lives; necessary to
calculate the correct log-likelihood.

<p>
<code>mode</code> - 
optional argument used to control the mode 
of calculation; it can be set to 0, 1 or 2 
corresponding to increasingly elaborate 
measure taken to reduce the amount of
numerical errors; mode = 0 will be fast but 
less accurate, mode = 2 will be slow but 
more accurate; the default mode is 0

<h3>Return</h3>
<code>llh</code> - 
the log-likelihood of data under a the Gaussian 
mixture.

<h3>Global variables</h3>
<code>gtmGlobalR</code> - 
an K-by-N responsibility matrix; 
gtmGlobalR(k,n) is the responsa-
bility takened by mixture component 
k for data point n.

<p>
<code>gtmGlobalDIST</code> - 
an K-by-N matrix in which element 
(k,n) is the Euclidean distance 
between the centre of component m 
and the data point n.

<p>
<code>gtmGlobalMinDist, gtmGlobalMaxDist</code> - 

vectors containing the minimum and 
maximum of each column in DIST, 
respectively; 1-by-N; required 
iff m > 0.
