<title>The GTM Toolbox: gtm_stp1</title>

<body><h1>gtm_stp1</h1>
Generates the components of a GTM with a 1D latent space.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>[X, MU, FI, W, beta] = gtm_stp1(T, noLatVarSmpl, noBasFn, s)</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<code>T</code> - 
target data, to be modelled by the GTM.

<p>
<code>noLatVarSmpl</code> - 
number of samples in the latent variable
space

<p>
<code>noBasFn</code> - 
number of basis functions

<p>
<code>s</code> - 
the width of basis functions relative
to the distance between two neighbouring 
basis function centres, i.e. if s = 1,
the basis functions will have widths
(std.dev) equal to (i.e. 1 times) the  
distance between two neighbouring basis  
function centres.  

<h3>Return</h3>
<code>X</code> - 
the grid of data points making up the
latent variable sample; a vector of length
noLatVarSmpl, in which each row is 
a data point

<p>
<code>MU</code> - 
a noBasFn-element vector holding the 
coordinates of the centres of the  
basis functions

<p>
<code>FI</code> - 
the activations of the basis functions when 
fed the latent variable sample X, and a bias 
unit fixed to 1.0; a matrix with the same 
number of rows as X and noBasFn+1 columns 
(+1 for the bias).

<p>
<code>W</code> - 
the initial matrix of weights, mapping
the latent variable sample X linearly
onto the first principal component
of the target data (T)

<p>
<code>beta</code> - 
the intial value for the inverse variance
of the data space noise model

<h3>Notes</h3>
The latent variable sample is constructed as a uniform
grid on the interval [-1, 1]. Similarly	the centres of 
the basis function are gridded uniformly over the latent 
variable sample, with equal standard deviation, set  
relative to the distance between two centres. The initial 
linear mapping maps mean and std.devs. 1:1 from	the latent 
to the target sample along the principal component.
