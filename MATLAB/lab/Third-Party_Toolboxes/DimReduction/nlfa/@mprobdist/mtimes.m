function c = mtimes(a, b)
% MTIMES matrix multiply mprobdists by probdists and numbers
%
%    The product is calculated as normal matrix product assuming
%    all probability distributions involved to be uncorreleted,
%    i.e. for call C = A * B, where A is a probdist and B a mprobdist
%      E[C] = E[A] * E[B]
%      Var[C] = E[A]^2 * Var[B] + Var[A] * E[B]^2 + Var[A] * Var[B];
%      Multivar[C] = E[A] * Multivar[B]
%      Extravar[C] = E[A]^2 * Extravar[B] + Var[A] * (E[B]^2 + Var[B])
%      
%    Both multiplicands must not be mprobdists.
%    This is because operation multivar*multivar is meaningless.
