Change History of NLFA Matlab package
-------------------------------------

This file contains a summary of all the changes since initial
released version 0.9.


nlfa-0.9.4 (2001-11-01)
-----------------------
  - Fixed a minor bug in the gradient computations in feedback.m.
    Thanks to Janne Kujala for finding the error.


nlfa-0.9.3 (2000-11-28)
-----------------------
  - Changed cost function computation so that the values reported
    in the middle of iterations are exact.  Previously there was
    a minor approximation because of efficiency, but it proved to
    cause too much trouble otherwise.  The change only affects the
    reported values of the cost function, not the values of any of
    the estimated parameters.


nlfa-0.9.2 (2000-08-03)
-----------------------
  - More fixes for one-dimensional data.


nlfa-0.9.1 (2000-08-02)
-----------------------
  - Source updates now work with one-dimensional data.
