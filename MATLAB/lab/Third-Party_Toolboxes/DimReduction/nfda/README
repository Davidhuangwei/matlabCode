Nonlinear Dynamic Factor Analysis Matlab package
version 0.9, 2002-03-25

This package is based on the Nonlinear Factor Analysis Matlab package

CONFIGURATION---------------------------------------------------------

The functions computevar and computervard use loops which are
time consuming in Matlab.  For efficiency, mex-files should be used.
They are provided for some architectures.  If you get an error
message, you need to compile the mex-files from computevar.c and
computevard.c.  If you get the message 'Invalid mex-file', you need to
remove the existing mex-file before compiling.

To compile, simply type
>> mex computevar.c
>> mex computevard.c
on Matlab prompt.
